### Project Demo
# Video
https://youtu.be/6OLcgpxCZdg
The demo video showcases the functionality and features of Live Freely in a clear and concise manner, but it may not evoke a strong emotional response from the client.
The fact that the chatbot behaves in a polite and non-judgmental way is excellent, as it creates a safe and comfortable space for users to express themselves freely.
This is particularly important for a mental health support platform like Live Freely, where users may be sharing sensitive or personal information.
By allowing users to ask anything freely, the chatbot encourages open and honest communication, which is essential for building trust and fostering a supportive relationship.
This approach can help users feel heard, validated, and supported, which can be incredibly empowering and therapeutic.
